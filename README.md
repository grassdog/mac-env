# My Mac environment setup

A script with a set of steps to bootstrap a new mac environment how I like it: [setup-env.sh](https://raw.github.com/grassdog/mac-env/master/setup-env.sh).

More a set of instructions rather than a runnable script.

Need to move to a chef solo/puppet/babushka approach instead whenever I
find the time.
